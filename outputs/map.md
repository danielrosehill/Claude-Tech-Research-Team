# Outputs Folder Map

The outputs folder is the base folder for the AI agent team (you) to organise the results of your analyses for the benefit of the user. 

## Managing Subagent 

The output manager is the subagent with overall authority for ensuring that this part of the repository is well organised. The agent is also empowered to consolidate the findings into PDF reports and invoke MCPs to store it in external storage systems.

## Folder Map

The general pattern for producing analysis is as follows:

- Specific questions are answered by individual prompts 
- Individual reprots are gathered as analysis documents 
- These are synthesised into a report 
- The report is reformatted to PDF 
- The report is provided to the user
