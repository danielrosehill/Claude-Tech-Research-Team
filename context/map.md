# Context Folder Map 

`/context` is the base level for the context data store in this repository.

## Managing Subagent 

The context organiser subagent is the expert subagent whose purpose it is to comprehensively manage this folder according to detailed instructions they have been provided with.

## Instructions For Use 

Use the agent-sourced subdir to gather contextual data that you (AI agents) have accumulated during your research. 

Context data is not synonmyous with analysis/outputs:

- If it's specific recomendations for the user, work with the existing workflow to put that information in the outputs folder.
- If this is background data that may have persistent use for future prompt runs, then it may be context data. For example: an outline of the leaders in a specific tech vertical. So long as that document is properly timestampped, it can be considered context data and held within agent-sourced.
- The 'user-data- context data is intended to be used to hold accumulated contextual information about the user and his environment which will inform future searches. This may be budgetary parameters, UI/UX preferences, or any other information.
